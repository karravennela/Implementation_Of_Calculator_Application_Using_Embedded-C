# Implementation of Calculator Application Using UART in Embedded C:
# Introduction:
- This project is implemented using hardware communication protocol i.e UART protocol.
- Embedded C is used to implement this protocol
# Features:
- It allows one to give arithmetic string expression as input.
- And the result is displayed after evaluating it according to the rules of arithmetic
# Test file:
- Calculator_Application_Version_3.o.hex:
